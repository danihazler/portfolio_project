# portfolio_project
Simple version of my portfolio. Project for Udacity Nanodegree.

## Observations

- Logo used is not mine. It is from another project/course.
- I left the main image (computer desk) with a "md" and a "xs" just to show an optimization method.
- Some of the Featured Work links doesn't take you anywhere, they are Wordpress projects.
